== Description ==
This plugin contains several tools in one package to significantly increase your control of the rel="nofollow" tag on every link on your blog, on both an individual and categorical basis. It is designed to give you fine-grained control of linking for SEO purposes.

The plugin's main features are: 

* The addition of a **nofollow checkbox when inserting links in posts**
* Several **nofollow shortcodes**
* A nofollow option for **individual blogroll links**
* Or a **nofollow for all blogroll links** option
* Add or remove the nofollow tag from **all links in comments**

== Installation ==
1. Download the latest zip file and extract the `nofollow` directory.
2. Upload it to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate `Ultimate Nofollow` on the `Plugins` menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I nofollow links I insert in my posts or pages? =
Just check the `add rel="nofollow" to link` option direction under the default `open link in a new window/tab` option.

= How do I use the shortcode? =
You can use any of these shortcodes to insert a nofollowed link `[relnofollow]`, `[nofollow]`, `[nofol]`, `[nofo]`, or `[nf]` using the following format:

`[nf href="http://link-url.com"]Link Text[/nf]`

You can also include the optional <a> attributes `title` and `target`. A full example would look like:

`[nf href="http://link-url.com" title="Link Title" target="_blank"]Link Text[/nf]`
